Culminating Assignment for ICS4U

This contains a simple engine, as well as a small demo "game".

The game allows the user to move around a simple .tmx tilemap and shoot bullets on click (either button).

Things demonstrated:
  Tilemap loading - the map itself
  Resource loading - mostly unused, the data from player.xml is loaded into the Player Resource
  Manager structure - Menu into game transision
  Physics and Standard entity - Bullets and player
  n-Sided polygon collision detection - player collision detection with walls
